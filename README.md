## Welcome to the MonaGIS Code Guide.

The intention is to use this repository to host our internal coding guidelines for the languages we use the most. The coding guidelines for each language should include a "Style Guide" as well as some tips for producing clean and maintainable code.

Resources used in the creation of these guides will be referenced.

### Guides

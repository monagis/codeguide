## Welcome to the MonaGIS Code Guide.

The intention is to use this repository to host our internal coding guidelines for the languages we use the most. The coding guidelines for each language should include a "Style Guide" as well as some tips for producing clean and maintainable code.

Resources used in the creation of these guides will be referenced.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/monagis/codeguide/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
